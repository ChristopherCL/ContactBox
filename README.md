A simple contact box written using Symfony 3.3. Users and their data such as telephone,
address and email are independent entities related to each other with appropriate relations.
The user has the ability to add, edit and delete their contacts. It is also possible to search for
users by name or surname. This functionality has been implemented using the DQL language.
Twig was used to display the templates, while the database uses Doctrine.
